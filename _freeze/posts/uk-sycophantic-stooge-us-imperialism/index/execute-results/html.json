It no longer sees any point in being reticent or even devious. It puts its cards on the table without fear or favour. It quite simply doesn't give a damn about the United Nations, international law or critical dissent, which it regards as impotent and irrelevant. It also has its own bleating little lamb tagging behind it on a lead, the pathetic and supine Great Britain.\n>\n> --- [Harold Pinter, *Art, Truth, & Politics* (2005)](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/pinter-lecture-e-1.pdf)\n\n[On Friday](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1144562), the UK abstained on a UN Security Council vote for a ceasefire in Gaza. The US vetoed it. [On Tuesday](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1144717?_gl=1*1m1hboy*_ga*MTk0MDc1OTM0Ni4xNjk4MDE1ODg3*_ga_TK9BQL5X7Z*MTcwMjU1NTg3Mi4xMC4xLjE3MDI1NTU5MTQuMC4wLjA.), the UK abstained again on a UN *General Assembly* vote for a ceasefire in Gaza. It passed. The Security Council vote would have been legally binding, the latter General Assembly vote is *non-binding* and symbolic - reflecting opinion amongst member states.\n\nWe cannot be naive about [who the UN serves and how](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii24/articles/peter-gowan-us-un), but it is not trivial that [82%](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1144717) of the General Assembly voted for the ceasefire (153 for, 10 against, 23 abstentions) compared to [68% previously for the truce](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/12/un-general-assembly-votes-overwhelmingly-in-favour-of-gaza-ceasefire) (121 for, 14 against, 44 abstentions).\n\nThe Palestinian people have refused to give up on their [long struggle for liberation and freedom](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/3293-from-the-river-to-the-sea). The latest General Assembly result reflects the organisation and pressure of [people worldwide in support of that struggle](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/11/photos-world-condemns-israels-war-on-gaza-as-it-marches-for-palestine). Though the power does not reside with the General Assembly, maintaining and increasing pressure on member states to call for a ceasefire is critical to save lives, and to influence what happens next.\n\nAs is well known[^1], the power sits with the US - the only member of the Security Council to [veto the resolution](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1144562). Of all the times the US has used its veto in the Security Council, [half have been to protect Israel](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzJ0U97OIFN/). The US arms (as do we), protects, and [supports Israel as the face of US imperialism in the Middle East](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HZs-v0PR44). The UK may have [inaugurated](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/origins-of-the-israel-palestine-conflict/id1639561921?i=1000606210302) settler colonialism in Palestine, but [in its decline as a global power, UK foreign policy ambitions were subordinated to the US](https://jacobin.com/2023/11/someone-elses-empire-book-review-tom-stevenson-uk-us-imperial-dominance-foreign-policy).\n\n[^1]: In 2021, after some discussion on several calls, Biden finally demanded Netanyahu stop the bombing of Gaza by saying \"Hey, man, we're out of runway here...It's over\". By the end of the call, \"Netanyahu reluctantly agreed to a cease-fire that the Egyptians would broker\" - [partial paraphrase of an excerpt from Frank Foer's \"The Last Politician\"](https://twitter.com/_waleedshahid/status/1719508855564939397?s=46)\n\nUnder this arrangement, it doesn't matter whether the UK is referred to as the [\"lieutenant\"](https://jacobin.com/2023/11/someone-elses-empire-book-review-tom-stevenson-uk-us-imperial-dominance-foreign-policy) of American foreign policy, or how many times the term [\"Special Relationship\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Relationship) is publicly employed by UK officials to feign a relationship among equals. This arrangement is vastly conditioned by US economic, political, and military interests. Previous [failures to comply by the UK have been rebuked by the US](https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/global-britain).\n\nAll this is to say, a stooge is a stooge, and each UK abstention from voting for a ceasefire in Gaza is complicity with genocide.\n\n## What we are complicit in\n\nLet us first be clear about what the UK has helped create ([historically](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/origins-of-the-israel-palestine-conflict/id1639561921?i=1000606210302) and [at present](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1144717) with [our](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/11/uk-factories-weapons-idf-gaza-protest-movement) [support](https://www.declassifieduk.org/britain-secretly-sent-500-extra-troops-to-cyprus-base-being-used-to-supply-weapons-to-israel/)), and what we are complicit in. I am not attempting this for completeness, novelty, or to lay claim to expertise that I don't possess. Instead, my aim is to summarise *some* of what can easily be learnt about the present situation. You may wish to skip this section if you are up to date. **Please correct me if I am mistaken.** I would encourage looking at the following sources:\n\n-   [Decolonize Palestine](https://decolonizepalestine.com/) and the [reading list](https://decolonizepalestine.com/reading-list/) they have put together\n\n-   [Al Jazeera - Israel-Gaza war in maps and charts: Live tracker](https://www.ft.com/israel-hamas-war)\n\n-   [Financial Times - The Israel-Hamas war in maps: latest updates](https://www.ft.com/content/42bbe534-8a0d-4ba8-9cc6-f84936d87196)\n\n-   [Gaza: An Inquest into Its Martyrdom - Norman Finkelstein](https://web.archive.org/web/20231023204550/https://arena-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/24103227/37e371a2bb2d8e8b7942c7baf08872d3.pdf?1697024979)\n\n-   [From the River to the Sea: Essays for a Free Palestine - Edited by Sai Englert, Michal Schatz and Rosie Warren](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/3293-from-the-river-to-the-sea)\n\nWe are witnessing an [ongoing Nakba](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/harvard-law-review-gaza-israel-genocide/). We are witnessing a [genocide](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/harvard-law-review-gaza-israel-genocide/) of the Palestinian people. Since October the 7th, [in Gaza and the West Bank at least 18,894 Palestinian people have been murdered by Israel - at least 7,794 of them children](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker).

There are no \"safe zones\". Flesh rots under the rubble. [Just as it has](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/world/africa/19iht-19gaza.19474057.html) [when this has happened before](https://www.visualizingpalestine.org/visuals/timeline-violence-2023).\n\nThe devastation wrought by the bombing has meant that [85% of the population has been displaced](https://www.ft.com/content/c09cc412-ae5c-423e-8e1d-b888d9f65598). [Almost all of the 2.3 million people have crowded into the south of Gaza](https://www.ft.com/content/c09cc412-ae5c-423e-8e1d-b888d9f65598) - bearing in mind, that the whole Gaza strip [already had one of the highest population densities in the world](https://www.ft.com/content/7b618433-ba5f-4e92-a3e0-d5d41d6d17f8). As a result, Palestinian people are [living on the streets](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/9/palestinians-displaced-to-south-gazas-overcrowded-areas-living-on-streets). The arrival of winter has exacerbated their suffering as [rains, winds, storms](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/10/people-will-die-in-the-streets-gaza-dreads-onset-of-winter-as-disease-rises), and now [floods](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/13/gaza-a-living-hell-after-heavy-winter-rains-drench-makeshift-tents), hit their [tents](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/13/gaza-a-living-hell-after-heavy-winter-rains-drench-makeshift-tents) and they have [no winter clothing](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-middle-east-67548831).\n\nThe remaining hospitals are overwhelmed - with [only 11 out of 36 \"partially functional\"](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-faces-public-health-disaster-un-humanitarian-office-says-2023-12-13/). They are [running out of medication and supplies](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/12/1218692478/gaza-hospital-israel-hamas-khan-younis), hospital procedures have taken place [without anesthetic](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/surgeon-flees-gaza-citys-last-functioning-hospital-after-anaesthetics-run-out-2023-11-17/), and humanitarian aid is [bottle-necked](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/9/people-are-starving-wfp-says-humanitarian-operation-in-gaza-collapsing) at a single checkpoint (but [Israel has said it will open a second checkpoint](https://www.ft.com/content/5b77d16c-945e-4033-93b4-b084129e52db)). People are [starving](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67670679). Sanitation conditions are [dire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/07/gaza-disease-clean-drinking-water). All of this combined with the extreme population density has meant that [disease](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/disease-could-kill-more-in-gaza-than-bombs-who-says-amid-israeli-siege) is spreading fast.\n\nWhat happens when Palestinians speak out? [The courageous and outspoken intellectual, Professor Refaat Alareer](https://electronicintifada.net/content/speak-we-owe-it-refaat/42621)[^2], was [assassinated by air strike](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/tamara-nassar/refaat-alareer-was-assassinated-israel) along with six members of his family. In a [powerful and poignant interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcY2KlllgPo), in the midst of bombardment, Professor Alareer [said the following](https://x.com/intifada/status/1732994197752307842?s=20):\n\n[^2]: I only learnt of Professor Refaat Alareer in October from a video posted by [Lowkey](https://twitter.com/Lowkey0nline). Despite my inital ignorance, I will not forget him.\n\n> I am an academic. Probably the toughest thing I have at home is an [Expo marker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_marker \"Expo marker\"). But if the Israelis invade, if they barge at us, charge at us open door-to-door to massacre us, I am going to use that marker to throw it at the Israeli soldiers, even if that is the last thing that I would be able to do. And this is the feeling of everybody. We are helpless. We have nothing to lose.\n>\n> --- Dr. Refaat Alareer\n\nThe Israeli army did not charge at Professor Refaat Alareer in person. They ordered an [airstrike](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/tamara-nassar/refaat-alareer-was-assassinated-israel). Think about this. The US, (arguably) the most powerful entity on Earth, arms, finances, protects, and supports Israel - [itself a nuclear power](https://thebulletin.org/premium/2022-01/nuclear-notebook-israeli-nuclear-weapons-2022/). And yet, the Israeli army could not face Professor Alareer in person. Instead they resorted to an airstrike. What might that say about Israel? What might that say about Professor Refaat Alareer? Professor Alareer's [final published poem](https://lithub.com/watch-brian-cox-read-if-i-must-die-by-murdered-palestinian-poet-refaat-alareer/) has been circulating and has been [translated into multiple languages](https://www.newarab.com/news/gaza-poet-refaat-alareers-words-live-new-translations) across the world.\n\nNothing can excuse these atrocities, and [people understand that](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/4/demonstrations-around-the-world-renew-calls-for-gaza-ceasefire), even if our politicians act within the confines of expedience, and some [would-be philosophers](https://www.normativeorders.net/2023/grundsatze-der-solidaritat/) engage in [all manner of ridiculous obfuscation in servility to power](https://dailynous.com/2023/11/28/proportionality-psychic-harm-and-the-day-after-guest-post/).\n\n## Analysing UN General Assembly votes\n\nIn this post, my main aim was to do some simple analysis of UN General Assembly votes in light of the UK's recent abstention. **Simply put, I wanted to look at how often the UK follows the US at the UN General Assembly, and see if I could shed light on some obvious patterns of subordination.**\n\nThe data I am using come from [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.1/12379) - Erik Voeten - Data and Analyses of Voting in the UN General Assembly - UNVotes.rda - updated 21/09/2023\n\nWhat follows, of course, comes with caveats. Click below to see them:\n\n::: {.callout-important collapse=\"true\"}\n## Caveats\n\n-   The data I am using is only available between 01/01/1946 - 30/06/2023. **So it does not include the most recent votes.**\n\n-   The issue classifications are based on \"searches in descriptions\", have been subjected to a \"rudimentary visual check\", and \"may not be 100% accurate\"\n\n-   The breakdown of the dataset coverage is as follows (I have copy and pasted this from the codebook):\n\n    -   ME: Votes relating to the Palestinian conflict (19%)\n\n    -   NU: Votes relating to nuclear weapons and nuclear material (13%)\n\n    -   DI: Votes relating to arms control and disarmament (16%)\n\n    -   CO: Votes relating to colonialism (18%)\n\n    -   HR: Votes relating to human rights (17%)\n\n    -   EC: Votes relating to (economic) development (9%)\n\n-   These classifications cover 92% of resolutions in the dataset. I have left out the 8% which have no classification (I think some of these cover e.g. votes about the UN itself).\n\n-   Whilst member states may choose to abstain for many reasons, I have chosen to interpret them alongside \"agree\" with the following disjunction *\"abstained or voted with X\"*. This is because I am interpreting abstentions as functionally equivalent to leaving a resolution unopposed - as the UK is now doing.\n\n-   The variable \"important\" refers to votes marked by the US state department as important in their yearly report on voting practices in the US. NOTE - IT IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR ALL YEARS. I have tried to make this clear.\n:::\n\n## UK vs the US at the UN General Assembly\n\nIn a nutshell, I've taken the UN General Assembly data, and counted how many times the UK has either voted against the US, OR abstained/voted with the US. I call this variable \"sycophancy\", and it should reveal the sort of patterns we're seeing now - where the UK does not directly disagree with the US, but does not oppose it.\n\nTwo interesting variables in this dataset. First, there is a classification for what issues are being voted on (e.g. Human Rights/Palestine) - so we can break votes down specifically to see UK votes on Palestine. Second, there is a variable called \"important votes\". These are votes marked by the US state department as important in their yearly report on UNGA voting practices. This classification has been available since 1983, and was created to keep an eye on countries who were receiving aid from the US. **I had a source for this claim - I need to find it**. For now, put in their own terms, the US State Department say:\n\n> Important issues are defined in the U.S. Department of State's annual U.S. Congressional Report on \"Voting Practices in the United Nations\" and by Public Law 101-246 which calls for, with respect to plenary votes for the UN General Assembly, a listing of \"votes on issues which directly affected important United States interests and on which the United States lobbied extensively.\" An essential basis for identifying \"important\" issues is their consistency with the State Department's Strategic Goals.\n>\n> [Source](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Report-Voting-Practices-in-the-United-Nations-2020.pdf)\n\nWe can reappropriate this classification for our own ends. Specifically, it would help track how often the UK goes along with key US interests - thus helping us track its obvious role as sycophantic stooge a bit better.

But I think being armed with the facts and having a clear picture of what is going on are too important to dismiss.
