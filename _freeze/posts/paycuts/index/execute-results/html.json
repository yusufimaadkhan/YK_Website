This is unnecessary. Ulster University and London Metropolitan University have publicly said they will make no deductions (for the moment). [Queen Mary University of London has managed to get a commitment](https://twitter.com/qm_ucu/status/1651493114446528512?s=20) from senior management to not deduct in response to MAB (for now and on the basis of a prior local agreement). [Hertfordshire University has managed to reduce deductions](https://twitter.com/UCU_UHerts/status/1651242998057803777?s=20) from 100% to a school by school formula. Meanwhile, 67 other universities have decided on arbitrarily large pay deductions in the midst of a cost of living crisis.\n\nWealthy vice chancellors stand behind this disgraceful choice. So I think it only makes sense to take a look at their salaries in light of this choice. On average, this group earn £300k and most of them are deciding to deduct between 50% and 100% of salaries. If we were to cut the salaries of the median vice chancellor by 50%, this would be £150k. That still leaves them comfortably [in the top 2% of earners by income in the UK](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/characteristics-and-incomes-top-1).\n\nPerhaps one might respond by saying the mechanisms that led to the decision to cut pay are more complex than blaming a single figurehead vice-chancellor. Agreed. But what is the point of these people if they are not accountable or liable for the decisions taken in the institutions they purport to run? Worse, there is an utter hypocrisy in leading an organisation where you condone pay cuts whilst sitting in the top 2% of earners.\n\nI've taken the list of pay cut threats that [Dr Kait Clark](https://twitter.com/DrKaitClark/status/1649038370029314052) compiled. I then combined this with [HESA data](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/finances/statements/senior-pay) on head of provider (or vice chancellor) remuneration.
