# YK_Website

This is the code for my personal _aCaDeMiC_ website. It houses some general background info, links to social media, resources, and my blog - _Rogue Analysis_. One day, I hope to post my academic research here too.   

I made this website ~with lots of googling, crying, and chocolate~ using Quarto, Github, and Netlify. I found these resources useful to get going:

- [Quarto Documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)
- [Creating a blog with Quarto in 10 steps](https://beamilz.com/posts/2022-06-05-creating-a-blog-with-quarto/en/) - Beatriz Milz
- [The ultimate guide to starting a Quarto blog](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html) - Albert Rapp

## A suggestion for which code might be vaguely interesting

Much of what I've done for now is fairly boilerplate. The documentation/content linked above is likely to be way more useful/clearer for setting up a website of your own.

The only code that might be of interest is the visualisation stuff ðŸ“ˆ. That all (hopefully) sits in ```YK_website/posts```. I'll update this ```README``` if things move around.

Ideally, I want to make every line of code written for the blog available within the blog. Maybe that's dumb because of code modularisation etc. but we'll see how it goes.
