I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics and Political Science. My research sits between political philosophy and social epistemology.

I completed my MSc in the Philosophy of the Social Sciences at the LSE in the Department of Philosophy, Logic, and Scientific Method. Before that, I completed my BA in Philosophy and Economics at Cardiff University.

In between my studies, I worked in the UK Government Economic Service in a few areas including international climate finance and local policy analysis.

I am also the Graphics Editor at [Phenomenal World](https://www.phenomenalworld.org/about/), where I make charts.

Welcome to my website! Here you can find my blog - [Rogue Analysis](blog.qmd)ðŸ“ˆ, and a [page of resources](resource-links.qmd) I've found handy.
