I am an [MRes/PhD](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2022/MResPhD-Political-Science) student in the [Department of Government at the London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/government). My research sits between political philosophy and social epistemology.

I completed my [MSc in the Philosophy of the Social Sciences](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2022/MSc-Philosophy-of-the-Social-Sciences) at the LSE in the [Department of Philosophy, Logic, and Scientific Method](https://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/). Before that, I completed my [BA in Philosophy and Economics](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/course/philosophy-and-economics-ba) at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/).

In between my studies, I worked in the [Government Economic Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/civil-service-government-economic-service) in a few areas including international climate finance and local policy analysis.
