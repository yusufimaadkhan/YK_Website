Moynihan is the chairman of the pro-Brexit, libertarian think tank, the Institute for Free Trade (IFT). The IFT’s president is Daniel Hannan, a former Conservative MEP who was appointed as a member of the House of Lords by Boris Johnson. Hannan was also one of “a swathe of free market think tankers” appointed to Liz Truss’ “refreshed Strategic Trade Advisory Group” in late 2020, when she was International Trade Secretary. Moynihan is also a director of the IEA Forum, the non-charitable arm of the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) – a libertarian think tank that advocates for a smaller state and lower taxes. The IEA is considered to be part of the ‘Tufton Street’ group of right-wing think tanks, characterised by their opaque funding and links to similar libertarian projects in the United States. He is also on the advisory council of the Free Speech Union – the project founded by short-lived government advisor and right-wing writer Toby Young. "
