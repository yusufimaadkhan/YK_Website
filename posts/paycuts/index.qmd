In response to UCU's [marking and assessment boycott (MAB)](https://www.ucu.org.uk/MAB2023), universities are threatening disproportionate and unjust pay deductions. This is unnecessary. Ulster University and London Metropolitan University have publicly said they will make no deductions (for the moment). [Queen Mary University of London has managed to get a commitment](https://twitter.com/qm_ucu/status/1651493114446528512?s=20) from senior management to not deduct in response to MAB (for now and on the basis of a prior local agreement). [Hertfordshire University has managed to reduce deductions](https://twitter.com/UCU_UHerts/status/1651242998057803777?s=20) from 100% to a school by school formula. Meanwhile, 67 other universities have decided on arbitrarily large pay deductions in the midst of a cost of living crisis.

Wealthy vice chancellors stand behind this disgraceful choice. So I think it only makes sense to take a look at their salaries in light of this choice. On average, this group earn £300k and most of them are deciding to deduct between 50% and 100% of salaries. If we were to cut the salaries of the median vice chancellor by 50%, this would be £150k. That still leaves them comfortably [in the top 2% of earners by income in the UK](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/characteristics-and-incomes-top-1).

Perhaps one might respond by saying the mechanisms that led to the decision to cut pay are more complex than blaming a single figurehead vice-chancellor. Agreed. But what is the point of these people if they are not accountable or liable for the decisions taken in the institutions they purport to run? Worse, there is an utter hypocrisy in leading an organisation where you condone pay cuts whilst sitting in the top 2% of earners.

I've taken the list of pay cut threats that [Dr Kait Clark](https://twitter.com/DrKaitClark/status/1649038370029314052) compiled. I then combined this with [HESA data](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/finances/statements/senior-pay) on head of provider (or vice chancellor) remuneration. Here is a glimpse of the dataset:

Next, I put this into a visual comparing head of university salary to the paycut threat, You can hover over and check who is who. Do let me know if the list of pay cuts needs updating.

## Caveats

Here are some caveats to my analysis:

-   Where vice chancellor/head of uni remuneration data is missing in HESA for this year, I have used previous years data

-   If it is still missing, I've looked up the VC salary e.g. for Bristol

-   I dropped Northumbria because the HESA figure seemed incorrect in comparison to light research (60k vs a few 100k). Also, the previous year of data was empty for them, and googling the salary came up with slightly out of date results

-   I took the list [Dr Kait Clark](https://twitter.com/DrKaitClark/status/1649038370029314052) compiled and updated it for developments at Hertfordshire and QMUL
