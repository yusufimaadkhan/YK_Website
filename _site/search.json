    "text": "Some further motivations\n\nRuthless criticism\nOn further reflection there are a few more strands of thought that tie in to what I hope to weave here. For one, Marx’s well known call for “ruthless criticism”:\n\n“If we have no business with the construction of the future or with organizing it for all time, there can still be no doubt about the task confronting us at present: the ruthless criticism of the existing order, ruthless in that it will shrink neither from its own discoveries, nor from conflict with the powers that be.”\n(Letter from Marx to Ruge - September 1843 - Accessible here.)\n\nI like the spirit here, and of particular interest to me is “conflict with the powers that be”. I am moving from a role that required political impartiality, to work that should be about far-reaching social and political criticism. Its a bit of a jarring transition, but its what I want to do. Reflecting on Marx’s words reminds me to resist slipping back into a weird political existence where policy is happening close by, but the range of acceptable criticism is minuscule.\n\n\nPhilosophy and public policy\nAnother strand of thought is the role of philosophy in public policy. I hope to write on matters of public policy. But here I agree with Chomsky that professional training in philosophy does not confer any “specific competence” to critique public policy, but it is a concern for philosophy:\n\n“There is no profession that can claim with greater authenticity that its concern is the intellectual culture of the society or that it possesses the tools for the analysis of ideology and the critique of social knowledge and its use.”\n\nThat said.\n\n\nThe open source community and its tools\nA final strand of thought is the open source community and its tools. I am quite taken"
