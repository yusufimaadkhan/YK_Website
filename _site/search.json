    "text": "Some further motivations\n\nRuthless criticism\nOn further reflection there are a few more strands of thought that tie in to what I hope to weave here. For one, Marx’s well known call for “ruthless criticism”:\n\n“If we have no business with the construction of the future or with organizing it for all time, there can still be no doubt about the task confronting us at present: the ruthless criticism of the existing order, ruthless in that it will shrink neither from its own discoveries, nor from conflict with the powers that be.”\n(Letter from Marx to Ruge - September 1843 - Accessible here.)\n\nI like the spirit here, and of particular interest to me is “conflict with the powers that be”. I am moving from a role that required political impartiality, to work that should be about far-reaching social and political criticism. Its a bit of a jarring transition, but its what I want to do. Reflecting on Marx’s words reminds me to resist slipping back into a weird political existence where policy is happening close by, but the range of acceptable criticism is minuscule.\n\n\nPhilosophy and public policy\nAnother strand of thought is the role of philosophy in public policy. I hope to write on matters of public policy. But here I agree with Chomsky that professional training in philosophy does not confer any “specific competence” to critique public policy, but it is a concern for philosophy:\n\n“There is no profession that can claim with greater authenticity that its concern is the intellectual culture of the society or that it possesses the tools for the analysis of ideology and the critique of social knowledge and its use.”\n\nThat said.\n\n\nThe open source community and its tools\nA final strand of thought is the open source community and its tools. I am quite taken"

    "text": "Workflow\nI am trying to sort all my tools out now so I can just focus on reading/writing without unnecessary headaches. I vacillate between thinking I should just return to pen + paper or use fancy tools because they might have cool epistemic benefits. You can skip this part if you’re happy with your set up.\n\nPlain Text?\nI hadn’t really given my workflow much thought until recently. After a bit of browsing I came across “The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science.” by Kieran Healy. This is addressed at new grad students deciding what software to use for their work. Healy makes the case for using tools that “give you more control over the process of data analysis and writing”. This seems like a good idea.\nNow I’m not following this guide to the letter, but its convinced me to implement some decent version control, use open source tools where possible, and write papers in markdown for easier formatting. Worth a look, but no use upending your workflow if you have a system that works for you.\n\n\nTaking Notes\nOkay a confession - I do not have a good set up for digital note taking. I want to experiment a bit and see what works. Maybe it seems ridiculous that I haven’t sorted this out yet, but there are umpteen note taking apps that do cool things and could help me out.\nGenerally I want to move to some kind of plain text set up because it enables a focus on content rather than format, would enable easy conversion to other formats, and allow for easy version control. See here for some benefits of plain text notes. Currently I’m messing with some horrible mix of:\n\nOneNote (not plain text)\nSimplenote\nObsidian\nGitJournal"

Anyway, there’s all sorts of advice flying around and one of the things you might come across are rankings of grad programmes. In this post I want to consider a potentially helpful tool for subjectively ranking grad programmes.\nWhen I was looking into grad school for philosophy/political theory, I was recommended the Philosophical Gourmet Report (can you imagine - a ranking for philosophy programmes). Initially, it seemed helpful because I had no idea what to do, and it had breakdowns for subject specialism. But, there are a number of important criticisms of this ranking, and indeed rankings in general. These criticisms center around:\nNow maybe you can construct a counter-argument based on judgment aggregation to the effect of:\n“these rankings pool the independent opinions of specialists in the field - so are likely to track well with quality of grad programmes and stuff”\nI have at least two concerns here."

    "text": "The recent £45bn “mini-budget”1 was a disaster in both content and consequence. This is widely understood. To believe it was about growth is beyond a joke. The government claimed that tax cuts for the rich will somehow lead to growth that will boost wages and support public services. This is either unsupported by the evidence, or the opposite is true. Shockingly, it turns out that tax cuts for the rich (who spend less and save more as a proportion of their income) will just benefit the rich.\nThe government then U-turned on plans to abolish the 45p additional rate of tax. For now, this still leaves roughly £43bn (by 2026-27) of tax cuts such as the cancelled increase in corporation tax from 19% to 25%, the reversal of the temporary increase in national insurance, and the cancellation of the Health and Social Care Levy2.\nSo why are the government doing this? Simple. Truss and her cabinet are sock puppets for corporate power to further their own interests - not a novel feature of politics. Perhaps they genuinely believe, against the evidence, that tax cuts will create growth and prosperity for all. If so, we should pity them and their ideological delusions - not partake in them.\nA recent article in the Byline Times highlights the influence of corporate power by investigating Truss’s donors who collectively gave £424,349 to her campaign. The Guardian updated this figure with new information taking the donation amounts to over £500,000. These articles draw on the MP’s register of interests and reveal a dodgy network of billionaires, hedge fund managers, investment bankers, and others that will use the government to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else.\nIf the remaining tax cuts in the “mini-budget” pass, this will concentrate the wealth of this dodgy network further, and give them even more power to buy off the government.\nIn this post, I wanted to explore a way of visualising this network of dodgy donors, and explore the landscape of UK political donations more generally."

I scraped the Byline Times article and just visualised the information (full credit to them). The orange circle in the center is Truss. The blue circles in orbit are each of the donors. The circles and links are scaled by the £ amount of their donation. In the interest of time, I haven’t got information on the additional donors mentioned in the Guardian here. So this covers £424,349 of donations.\nThe two largest blue circles each represent £100k of donations from Fitriani Hay and Natasha Barnaba. You can hover over to see more information about them. Also of note is Andrew Law (smaller circle - southeast) - who donated £5,127. Law hosted a champagne reception after the mini budget with Kwasi Kwarteng in attendance.\nAnyway there is much to be improved here4, but I think it serves to illustrate the dodgy financing network surrounding Truss and co. In the future, I hope to return to this sort of representation after some improvement. Obvious props to Sophie E. Hill’s “My Little Crony” for inspiration. Lets take it a bit further."

    "text": "Further Analysis - A Brief Look at UK Political Donations\nSo we’ve had a quick look at the recent donors surrounding Truss. But how do things look beyond just Truss’s donors? What does the landscape of political donations in the UK look like?\nTo answer this, I’ve taken data from the Electoral Commission website for political donations in 2022 to date (all available quarters). I am focusing on Con/Lab/Lib/SNP, and I’ve tidied it up like so:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Get list of MPs and donations from 2022\n\nmps <- read_csv(\"mps.csv\")\n\ndon <- read_csv(\"2022-electoral-commission-donations.csv\")\n\n# Cleaning donation names\n\ndon <- don %>% \n  mutate(RegulatedEntityName = str_remove_all(RegulatedEntityName, \"Dr |Ms |Mrs |Mr |The Rt Hon |Rt Hon | MP| MP |Dame |Sir \")) %>% \n  select(DonorName,DonorStatus,RegulatedEntityName,RegulatedDoneeType,Value)\n\n# Merge first and last name in MPs so we can make a lookup to party\n\nmps <- mps %>%\n  select(`First name`,`Last name`, Party) %>% \n  mutate(`Full name` = paste(`First name`,`Last name`, sep = \" \"))\n\n# Join donation data and MP/party lookup\n\ndon_by_party <- don %>% \n  full_join(mps, by=c(\"RegulatedEntityName\"=\"Full name\")) %>% \n  filter(!is.na(Value)) %>% # get rid of no donations\n\n# Classify the donations that go to parties rather than individuals.

I sum these and aggregate to get the total donations going towards the party. I have checked, and I don’t think this double counts. Do let me know if you reckon otherwise.\n\nMost of the Conservative Party’s funding comes from individuals and companies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoughly £14m of the £17m in donations received by the Conservative Parties so far this year has been from individuals and businesses. Not hugely surprising, but interesting to compare to the donation sources of the other parties. Its worth mentioning that opposition parties receive the bulk of public funding through the “Short Money” payment to fund their activities.\nSo that’s a broad look at the types of donors, quantums involved, and parties receiving donations. As they’re proving so lucrative for the Conservative Party, lets zoom in a bit on individual and company donations.\n\n\nThe top 10% of Conservative donors who are individuals make up 38% of total party donations in 2022 so far…\n\nJitterOrdered dots\n\n\nMedian donation from individual towards party: £10,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nI have used a log scale here to better view the distribution and ordering. Also I don’t like how the ordered points obscure the density/overplotting. The jitter is probably better here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/site-information/foi/transparency-publications/hoc-transparency-publications/financial-information/financial-assistance-to-opposition-parties/\nPUT MP REGISTER DATE\nA few things to note.\nSo there you have it. Much like an actual dodgy doner, Truss and her dodgy donors will poison this country - leaving it sick, weak, and forever in the toilet.\nAdd a bit about Andrew Law and Kwarteng\nThe break between markets and hedge funds\nNote somewhere about how you’ve taken non-cash values\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/05/liz-truss-raised-500000-for-bid-to-be-leader-register-of-interests-reveals UPDATE THE QUANTUMS"

    "text": "blah blah\nThe recent £45bn “mini-budget”1 was a disaster in both content and consequence. This is widely understood. To believe it was about growth is beyond a joke. The government claimed that tax cuts for the rich will somehow lead to growth that will boost wages and support public services. This is either unsupported by the evidence, or the opposite is true. Shockingly, it turns out that tax cuts for the rich (who spend less and save more as a proportion of their income) will just benefit the rich.\nThe government has just U-turned on plans to abolish the 45p additional rate of tax. For now, this still leaves roughly £43bn (by 2026-27) of tax cuts such as the cancelled increase in corporation tax from 19% to 25%, the reversal of the temporary increase in national insurance, and the cancellation of the Health and Social Care Levy2.\nSo why are the government doing this? Simple. Truss and her cabinet are sock puppets for corporate power to further their own interests - not a novel feature of politics. A recent article in the Byline Times looks at this by investigating Truss’s donors who collectively gave £424,349 to her campaign. The article draws on the MP’s register of interests and reveals a dodgy network of billionaires, hedge fund managers, investment bankers, and others that will use the government to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else.\nIf the remaining tax cuts in the “mini-budget” pass, this will concentrate the wealth of this dodgy network further, and give them even more power to buy off the government.\nIn this post, I wanted to explore a way of visualising this network of dodgy donors, and explore the landscape of UK political donations more generally."

What does the landscape of political donations in the UK look like? For some good general breakdowns - see the Electoral Commissions visuals. For a general report on the influence of big finance on democracy in the UK, see this report published by Positive Money over the summer. This is an incredibly comprehensive report, and they suggest a number of recommendations that you’d think would already be implemented as common sense.\nAnyway, to have my own look at the landscape, I’ve taken data from the Electoral Commission website5 for political donations reported6 in 2022 to date.

I sum these and aggregate to get the total donations going towards the party. I have checked, and I don’t think this double counts. Do let me know if you reckon otherwise.\nI’ve summed the value of cash and non-cash donations. Yes this is crude and it relies on them reliably stating the value of any in-kind transfers. Not sure what to do otherwise. Also I’m sure there are so many other unmonetised benefits that accrue from the social aspects of networks (I’m not using this as an excuse, just pointing it out)\nDonations listed on the Electoral Commission website are only reported if they meet certain conditions (e.g. if its a donation to the central party, then its reported if the donation is greater than or equal to £7,500 - or over £1500 if the donor or lender gives further during the calendar year). I think this means when I say x% of total donations come from y, that total is only total disclosed donations rather than all donations received by the party (I don’t think 100 people only donating £50 each would be reported). So every time I use the donations data to make claims about sources and totals, only reported donations are in scope.7\n\n\nMost of the Conservative Party and MP donations come from individuals and companies\nPolitical donations to the major parties broken down by donor status. Figures given for donations reported in 2022 so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoughly £14m of the £17m in donations received by the Conservative Parties so far this year has been from individuals and companies. Not hugely surprising, but interesting to compare to the donation sources of the other parties. Its worth mentioning that opposition parties receive the bulk of public funding through the “Short Money” payment8 to fund their activities.\nSo that’s a broad look at the types of donors and quantums involved for the major parties. As individual and company donations are proving so lucrative for the Conservative Party, lets zoom in a bit on them.\n\n\nThe top 10% of individual Conservative Party and MP donors make up 38% of their total donations...\nHover over circles for information.\n\nJitterOrdered dots\n\n\nDashed line represents median of all donations from individuals to the major parties: £10,000\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Nah change this to ordered points - the jitter is too dense - if its ordered points I can put the median there too.\n\nmedian_indiv_don <- don_by_party_indiv %>% \n  filter(DonorStatus==\"Individual\") \n\nmedian_indiv_don <- median(median_indiv_don$Value)\n\nsum_party <- don_by_party_indiv %>%\n  group_by(Party_Name) %>% \n  summarise(sum(Value)) %>% \n  rename(total_don = `sum(Value)`)\n\ndon_top_dec <- don_by_party_indiv %>% \n  filter(DonorStatus==\"Individual\") %>% \n  group_by(Party_Name) %>% \n  mutate(decile=ntile(Value,n=10)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  group_by(decile,Party_Name) %>% \n  summarise(sum(Value)) %>% \n  ungroup()\n\ntitle_stat <- don_top_dec %>% \n  left_join(sum_party,by=\"Party_Name\") %>% \n  mutate(perc = `sum(Value)`/total_don)\n\n# should I chuck all my theming stuff in a function?

Lets take a closer look at some of these donors.\n\nThat small dot to the right is Christopher Charles Sheriff Harborne - a businessman and tech investor who has given £1,015,000 so far this year. Harborne was a massive donor to the Brexit party and had been a regular donor to the Conservative Party in previous years.\nNext to Christopher is Mark J Bamford - the chairman of the machinery manufacturer JCB who has given £973,000 so far this year. Another big supporter of Brexit.\nIn third place its Malcom S Healey - an entrepreneur/businessman/rich person (if only there was some word for sitting around and accumulating wealth because you own things) who has donated £550,000 so far this year\n\nI’d encourage you to hover over the names and do some googling. If there’s a concern that I’m unfairly singling out the Conservative donors whilst ignoring the large donations from individuals to other parties:\n\nThese other parties are not currently in power - so I’m less focused on them\nLarge political donations and the capture of politics by wealth is a problem for any party/organisation/etc. - e.g. see the failure of Labour under Blair to push the matter of capping political donations early in their first term, the Cash-for-Honours scandal, and then the failure of Labour, the Lib Dems, and Conservatives to agree to the suggestions in the Phillips review\n\nWe can do the same comparisons for donations from companies.\n\n\nMore companies give larger donations to the Conservative Party than the other parties. However, the maximum donations from companies are still smaller than donations from some individuals\nHover over circles for information.\n\nJitterOrdered dots\n\n\nDashed line represents median of all donations from companies to the major parties: £10,000 (yes I believe this is also £10k like the indiv. donations)\n\n\nCode\n# Nah change this to ordered points - the jitter is too dense - if its ordered points I can put the median there too.\n\nmedian_comp_don <- don_by_party_indiv %>% \n  filter(DonorStatus==\"Company\") \n\nmedian_comp_don <- median(median_comp_don$Value)\n\n\np <- don_by_party_indiv %>% \n  filter(grepl(\"Company\",DonorStatus)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Party_Name,Value,label=DonorName,fill=Party_Name)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha=0.6,size=2,grouponX=TRUE,colour=\"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = \" k\", scale = 1e-3)) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.text = element_text(face=\"bold\",size = 10),\n        axis.title = element_text(face=\"bold\",size = 12)) +\n  coord_flip()+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 10000,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"navy\",\"red\",\"gold\",\"yellow\")) +\n  xlab(\"\") + ylab(\"Donation Amount (£)\")\n\n\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\nCompany refers to a UK-registered company which is incorporated in the UK and carries on business in the UK.

I think the absolute value is also important.

    "section": "Ingredients",
    "text": "Ingredients\nRight. Ingredients. What do we need? Well for starters, we need some reason that there’s a black hole to begin with. In this case, these are fiscal rules. Here are the latest set in season:\n\nFiscal policy decisions will be guided by updated fiscal rules, which require public sector net debt (excluding the Bank of England) to be falling as a percentage of GDP and public sector net borrowing to be below 3% of GDP by the fifth year of the rolling forecast.\n\nSource: Policy paper Autumn Statement 2022 HTML\nIf we miss the fiscal rules, we get the black hole - bish bash bosh. The government have changed the fiscal rules a few times in the past decade without really providing a clear justification for what they’re targeting and why. But hey lets not think about that too much! RULES ARE RULES 😤 (even if the government comes up with them and then…gets rid of them…and then claims the new ones should bind policy…and then…never mind). More cooking, less thinking.\nNow you might ask why does public sector net borrowing have to be below 3% of GDP and falling by the fifth year of the forecast?\nWell are you NOT COMMITTED TO THE RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC FINANCES? 😤\n…Oh you are? You’re just wondering where the figures come from, whether this is necessary right now, concerned about funding public services properly, and having the flexibility to respond to current macroeconomic conditions?\nWell DO YOU NOT CARE ABOUT ANCHORING MARKET EXPECTATIONS? THEY’LL EAT US ALIVE. NO RULES? THE BAILIFFS WILL COME AND TAKE THE GOVERNMENT’S SOFA.\n\n\n\nDodgy meme made by me, google images, and photopea.com\n\n\nDID YOU NOT SEE WHAT HAPPENED WITH KWARTENG’S BUDGET? (which absolutely was not driven by a range of factors including uncertainty about unfunded cuts, the state of public services, and the inflationary environment). DO YOU WANT THAT? 😤\n…Oh you weren’t saying no rules? And its probably helpful to communicate clearly to the markets? And the markets don’t care about your expectations? And the government in fact underlies the system of markets, is the only entity powerful enough to control them, and the illusion that the government are somehow impotent against the markets is an ideological fantasy designed to entrench the view that there is no alternative?\n…Okay look. Just run with it. Also a bunch of other countries are doing this whole fiscal black hole thing and ratcheting up their fiscal rules. Apparently…my friend told me…my friend’s friend…called Heremy Junt.\nJust…don’t ask too many questions. Stop trying to be clever. You’ll spoil this cooking blog for everyone.\nWhat else what else. Okay we need a few more ingredients for the fiscal black hole. These are:\n\nThe effective interest rate on the national debt\nThe GDP growth rate\nAnd the crucial special ingredient - the density of the media coverage 🙃\n\nNow this won’t be the full thing because the Rogue Analysis cooking blog budget doesn’t stretch to incorporating the dynamics of multi-year trends, stock-flow adjustments, and what have you. Sadly we also lack the budget for numbers attached to the black hole. Because citing a number without any context usually really helps, right? Apologies 😞. Even so, we can make something resembling the fiscal black hole with these three ingredients and the fiscal rules!"

    "text": "Last week LSE UCU published a report called “The Crisis of Academic Casualisation at LSE”. I would recommend taking a look. They summarise their main findings in a twitter thread too. It is a damning indictment of LSE and its purported aims as a so called higher education institution. Take a look at one of the highlights:\nIn truth, it makes you ashamed to be associated with such a racket. LSE have created precarity for staff. LSE increase the intake of domestic and international students and gladly take their money. LSE MSc courses are ridiculously priced and sometimes very similar courses have massive price differentials solely due to names. LSE have money to spend on buildings named after benefactors but they can’t help build the careers of fixed-term staff. Don’t get me started on the fact that they named a building after Paul Marshall (yes the GB news investor and leave campaign funder). Recently, LSE unilaterally disaffiliated from Stonewall without any prior consultation or decent explanation to students and staff. LSE (like many universities) is an institution that serves power and pays lip service to the interests of staff and students. There is much more to say here1 but I’ll move on to the topic at hand.\nIn response to LSE UCU’s casualisation report I saw a few people saying they’d like to see similar analysis for their institution. LSE UCU also encouraged others to make use of their code to conduct similar analysis. So I thought why not try and do similar analysis for every institution? It could be useful and I like a challenge.\nI’d like to stress that all of what follows builds on analysis from Marion Lieutaud (2023) and LSE UCU members. Lieutaud drew on HESA (Higher Education Statistics Authority) data for much the analysis. The heavy of lifting of getting the data in a good format was basically already done by Lieutaud. All I’ve done is taken that data and shoved it in some charts so you can (hopefully) see every institution."

Russell Group universities tend to have a higher proportion of staff on fixed term contracts. They are leading universities…for casualisation.

    "text": "Conclusion\nSo I rushed a bit to get this out. I might go back and redraft this post when I have more time. But I hope that was useful. A key takeaway here is that the share and trend of casualisation differs across institutions but is somewhat concentrated in the Russell Group/larger unis/larger cities (okay yes that is not very shocking). I wasn’t able to do a proper dig into the data, but I’d encourage you to take a look yourself and think about the trends. I am sure there is so much more analysis to be done.\nPlease let me know if you spot any issues or have any suggestions. Given the work I have to do, I can’t promise I’ll get to it. But we’ll see! Once again, do check out the LSE UCU report on casualisation. You can also take a look at my code here, for this blog post here, or you can click the button on the top right of this page to view code. I’ve also saved the cleaned up dataset as a csv in this folder on github.\nI should probably close with some words of support for the union and strikes, but I hope the work above conveys my support.\nSolidarity forever."

    "text": "Annex: An attempt to view pressures across the sector\nI added this extra chart on 10/04/2023. It is a bit dense, but I was attempting to view pressures across the sector by looking at:\n\nThe student to permanent staff ratio (x axis)\n% of fixed-term staff (y axis)\nTotal number of students (size of ◯ )\nBroken down by Russell Group/wider sector\nDisaggregated for institution (individual ◯ )\n\nAll between 2014/15 - 2021/22. It would be great if we could go back a few more years to see the proper effect of lifting the student number cap.\nI thought this chart might help explore and explain where the pressures lie in the sector. A movement to the northeast would suggest increased pressure in the sector as the student to permanent staff ratio increases (X) and more fixed-term staff are brought in (Y).\nWhilst its dense, lets focus on the Russell Group for a second. The boom in student numbers (size of ◯ ) is accompanied by increases in the student to permanent staff ratio. But there is a much more dramatic pivot to fixed-term staff - especially for LSE, KCL, and QMUL.\nNext, lets focus on the wider sector. Student numbers have also boomed. The % of staff that are fixed-term has also increased, but what is more dramatic is the increase in the student to permanent staff ratio.\nSo the Russell Group can respond to the crisis of higher education by pumping up fixed term contracts (especially if domestic and international student numbers have increased), but the wider sector faces greater pressure from student numbers on permanent staff.\nSo my rough interpretation is something like, Russell Group use improved financial position, “prestige” attraction, and cash flow from booming student numbers (domestic but especially international) to keep pressures at bay. But the rest of the sector can do this to a lesser extent and feels the direct pressure of increased student numbers hitting the student to permanent staff ratio.\nLet me know if you disagree and what you reckon!

    "title": "The Vices of the Vice-Chancellors",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In response to UCU’s marking and assessment boycott (MAB), universities are threatening disproportionate and unjust pay deductions. This is unnecessary. Ulster University and London Metropolitan University have publicly said they will make no deductions (for the moment). Queen Mary University of London has managed to get a commitment from senior management to not deduct in response to MAB (for now and on the basis of a prior local agreement). Hertfordshire University has managed to reduce deductions from 100% to a school by school formula. Meanwhile, 67 other universities have decided on arbitrarily large pay deductions in the midst of a cost of living crisis.\nWealthy vice chancellors stand behind this disgraceful choice. So I think it only makes sense to take a look at their salaries in light of this choice. On average, this group earn £300k and most of them are deciding to deduct between 50% and 100% of salaries. If we were to cut the salaries of the median vice chancellor by 50%, this would be £150k. That still leaves them comfortably in the top 2% of earners by income in the UK.\nPerhaps one might respond by saying the mechanisms that led to the decision to cut pay are more complex than blaming a single figurehead vice-chancellor. Agreed. But what is the point of these people if they are not accountable or liable for the decisions taken in the institutions they purport to run? Worse, there is an utter hypocrisy in leading an organisation where you condone pay cuts whilst sitting in the top 2% of earners.\nI’ve taken the list of pay cut threats that Dr Kait Clark compiled.

On average, this group earns £300k and we are in a cost of living crisis\n\n\nHover to see institution names.\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof facet_cat = Inputs.toggle({label: \"Combine together?\", values: [null, \"paycut_amount\"]});\n\nimport {Plot} from \"@mkfreeman/plot-tooltip\";\n\nboxdata = transpose(remun_head_paycut_df_convert);\n\nPlot.plot({\n  height: 610,\n  marginBottom: 60,\n  \n  x: {\n    className: \"axis-lab\",\n    label: \"Head of University Salary (£000s)→\",\n    grid: true,\n    nice: true,\n    ticks: 5,\n    labelOffset: 55\n  },\n  \n  y: {\n    label: \"Pay cuts\",\n    grid: true,\n    ticks: null\n  },\n  \n  facet: {data: boxdata, y: facet_cat, marginLeft: 70},\n  \n  sort: {fy: \"y\"},\n  \n  fy: {label:\"Pay cuts\",domain: [\"100%\", \"80%\", \"60%\", \"50%\", \"25%\", \"20%\"]},\n  \n  marks: [\n  \n    Plot.frame(),\n  \n    Plot.dot(boxdata, \n    \n    Plot.dodgeY({\n      x: \"imput_tot_remun_b4_sal_sac\", \n      fill: \"paycut_amount\",\n      stroke: \"black\",\n      anchor: \"middle\", \n      r: 5.5,\n      fillOpacity: 0.8,\n      padding: 0.5,\n      title: (d) =>`${d.he_provider} \\n VC Salary: £${d.imput_tot_remun_b4_sal_sac},000 \\n Pay cuts: ${d.paycut_amount}`\n      }))\n      \n  ],\n  \n  color: {\n  legend: false,\n  domain: [\"100%\", \"80%\", \"60%\", \"50%\", \"25%\", \"20%\"],\n  scheme: \"Reds\",\n  reverse: true,\n  style: {\n  fontSize: \"1em\"}\n  },\n  \n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity head salary vs. proposed pay cuts in response to marking and assessment boycott  Broken down by pay cut amount and institution.
